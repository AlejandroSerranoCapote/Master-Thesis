abstract = {We report measurements of the refractive index of undoped yttriumaluminum garnet from 0.4 to 5.0 $\mu$m and the calculation ofSellmeier coefficients based on our data. The data differconsiderably from previously published reports. The effect of thenew data on the design of optical devices such as intracavity etalonsfor lasers is discussed.},
